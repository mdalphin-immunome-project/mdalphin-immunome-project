- Hi, I’m Mark Dalphin with the Human Immunome Project (@mdalphin-immunome-project).
- I’m a computational biologist working on data management, data integration and data analysis for the [EU INCENTIVE project](https://www.incentive-h2020.eu/en/).
- Part of the INCENTIVE Project includes publishing _all_ their data in a F.A.I.R. manner; we are using a distributed data approach based on [FAIR Data Points](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint). So I am learning about the symantic web, and RDF at a rapid pace.
- You can contact me at: mdalphin AT immunomeproject.org
